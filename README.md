# OpenWrt for Amlogic s9xxx tv box

View Chinese description  |  [æŸ¥çœ‹ä¸­æ–‡è¯´æ˜Ž](README.cn.md)

The [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) Project is a Linux router operating system targeting embedded devices. Instead of trying to create a single, static firmware, OpenWrt provides a fully writable filesystem with package management. Allows you to freely choose the software package you need to customize your router system. For developers, OpenWrt is the framework to build an application without having to build a complete firmware around it; for users this means the ability for full customization, to use the device in ways never envisioned. It has more than 3000+ standardized application packages and a very rich third-party plug-in support, so you can easily replicate the same setup on any supported device.

Now you can replace the Android TV system of the TV box with the Amlogic chip with the OpenWrt system, making it a powerful router. This project supports `github.com One-stop compilation`, `Use GitHub Action to packaging`, `Use github.com Releases rootfs file to packaging`, `Local packaging`. including OpenWrt firmware install to EMMC and update related functions. Support Amlogic s9xxx tv box are ***`a311d, s922x, s905x3, s905x2, s912, s905d, s905x, s905w, s905`***, etc. such as ***`Belink GT-King, Belink GT-King Pro, UGOOS AM6 Plus, X96-Max+, HK1-Box, H96-Max-X3, Phicomm-N1, Octopus-Planet, Fiberhome HG680P, ZTE B860H`***, etc.

The latest version of the OpenWrt firmware can be downloaded in [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/releases). Welcome to use `Fork` for [personalized OpenWrt firmware configuration](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/router-config/README.md). If you like it, Please click the `Star`.

ðŸ’¡Tip: The current box of ***`s905`*** can only be used in `TF/SD/USB`, and other types of boxes can also be used in `EMMC` at the same time. The ***`s905w`*** boxs currently only support `5.4` kernels, Cannot use kernel version 5.10 and above, Other devices can be freely selected. Please refer to the [instructions](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-armbian/blob/main/build-armbian/amlogic-u-boot/README.md) for dtb and u-boot of each device.

## Install to EMMC and update instructions

Choose the corresponding firmware according to your box. Then write the IMG file to the USB hard disk through software such as [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) or [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/). Insert the USB hard disk into the box. Common for all `Amlogic s9xxx tv box`.

- ### Install OpenWrt

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’ `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `Amlogic Service` â†’ `Install OpenWrt`, Select your box in the Supported Devices drop-down list and click the `Install OpenWrt` button to install it.

- ### Update OpenWrt

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `Amlogic Service` â†’ `Upload updates manually / Download updates online`

If you choose `Upload Updates Manually` [OpenWrt firmware](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/releases), You can upload the corresponding OpenWrt firmware package, such as openwrt_s9xxx_k5.15.25_xxx.img.gz (It is recommended to upload the compressed package, and the system will automatically decompress it. If you upload the decompressed xxx.img file, the upload may fail because the file is too large), After the upload is complete, the interface will display the `Update firmware` operation button, click to update.

If you choose `Manually upload updates` [OpenWrt kernel](https://github.com/ophub/kernel/tree/main/pub/stable), You can upload the three kernel files `boot-xxx.tar.gz`, `dtb-amlogic-xxx.tar.gz`, `modules-xxx.tar.gz` (Other kernel files are not required. If uploading at the same time does not affect the update, the system can accurately identify the required kernel files.)ï¼ŒAfter the upload is complete, the interface will display the `Update Kernel` operation button, click to update.

If you choose `Online Download Update` OpenWrt firmware or kernel, it will be downloaded according to `Firmware download address` and `Kernel download address` in `Plugin Settings`, you can customize and modify the download source, For details, please refer to the compilation and usage instructions of [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic).

Tip: Functions such as install/update are provided by [luci-app-amlogic](https://github.com/ophub/luci-app-amlogic) to provide visual operation support. Also supports [command operations](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/router-config/README.md#8-install-the-firmware).

- ### Use OpenWrt in TF/SD/USB

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command

```yaml
openwrt-tf
```

After activating the remaining space, the kernel and OpenWrt system can be upgraded in TF/SD/USB.

- ### Create swap for openwrt system

If you feel that the memory of the current box is not enough when you are using applications with a large memory footprint such as `docker`, you can create a `swap` virtual memory partition, Change the disk space of `/mnt/*4` A certain capacity is virtualized into memory for use. The unit of the input parameter of the following command is `GB`, and the default is `1`.

Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command

```yaml
openwrt-swap 1
```

- ### Backup/restore the original EMMC system

Supports backup/restore of the box's `EMMC` partition in `TF/SD/USB`. It is recommended that you back up the Android TV system that comes with the current box before installing the OpenWrt system in a brand new box, so that you can use it in the future when restoring the TV system.

Please start the OpenWrt system from `TF/SD/USB`, Log in to the default IP: 192.168.1.1 â†’  `Login in to openwrt` â†’ `system menu` â†’ `TTYD terminal` â†’ input command

```yaml
openwrt-ddbr
```

According to the prompt, enter `b` to perform system backup, and enter `r` to perform system recovery.

ðŸ’¡Tip: You must use the `/mnt/*4/` space to store the `BACKUP-arm-64-emmc.img.gz` backup file, Users who have not created the `TF/SD/USB` extended partition must first use the `openwrt-tf` command to create the extended partition.

## Compilation and packaging method

Provide multiple ways to generate the OpenWrt firmware you need. Please choose one method you like. Each method can be used independently.

- ### Local packaging instructions

1. Install the necessary packages (E.g Ubuntu 20.04 LTS user)
```yaml
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get full-upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install -y $(curl -fsSL git.io/ubuntu-2004-openwrt)
```
2. Clone the repository to the local. `git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt.git`
3. Create a `openwrt-armvirt` folder, and upload the OpenWrt firmware of the ARM kernel ( Eg: `openwrt-armvirt-64-default-rootfs.tar.gz` ) to this `~/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/openwrt-armvirt` directory.
4. Enter the `~/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt` root directory. And run Eg: `sudo ./make -d -b s905x3 -k 5.4.180`. The generated OpenWrt firmware is in the `out` directory under the root directory.

- ### Github.com One-stop compilation instructions

You can modify the configuration file in the `router-config` directory and `.yml` file, customize the OpenWrt firmware, and complete the packaging online through `Actions`, and complete all the compilation of OpenWrt firmware in github.com One-stop.

1. Personalized plug-in configuration in [router-config](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/router-config) directory. Workflows configuration in [.yml](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-openwrt-lede.yml) file.
2. Select ***`Build OpenWrt`*** on the [Action](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/actions) page. Click the ***`Run workflow`*** button.

```yaml
- name: Build OpenWrt firmware
  id: build
  run: |
    [ -d openwrt-armvirt ] || mkdir -p openwrt-armvirt
    cp -f openwrt/bin/targets/*/*/*.tar.gz openwrt-armvirt/ && sync
    sudo chmod +x make
    sudo ./make -d -b s905x3_s905x2_s905x_s905w_s905d_s922x_s912 -k 5.15.25_5.4.180
    echo "PACKAGED_OUTPUTPATH=${PWD}/out" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "PACKAGED_OUTPUTDATE=$(date +"%Y.%m.%d.%H%M")" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "::set-output name=status::success"
```

The output variable ${{ env.PACKAGED_OUTPUTPATH }} is the path where the packaged file is located.

- ### Use github.com Releases rootfs file to packaging

If there is an `openwrt-armvirt-64-default-rootfs.tar.gz` file in a [Releases](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/releases) in your repository, you can use this file to directly package the required firmware.

- `openwrt_s9xxx_.*` is Prefix the `tag_name` in the Release.
- `openwrt-armvirt-64-default-rootfs.tar.gz` is the firmware you are going to package, please refer to [router-config](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/tree/main/router-config) for compilation method.

[For more instructions please see: use-releases-file-to-packaging.yml](https://github.com/ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt/blob/main/.github/workflows/use-releases-file-to-packaging.yml)

```yaml
- name: Build OpenWrt firmware
  id: build
  run: |
    [ -d openwrt-armvirt ] || mkdir -p openwrt-armvirt
    curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/releases" | grep -o "openwrt_s9xxx_.*/openwrt-armvirt-.*\.tar.gz" | head -n 1 > DOWNLOAD_URL
    [ -s DOWNLOAD_URL ] && wget -q -P openwrt-armvirt https://github.com/${GITHUB_REPOSITORY}/releases/download/$(cat DOWNLOAD_URL)
    sudo chmod +x make
    sudo ./make -d -b s905x3_s905x2_s905x_s905w_s905d_s922x_s912 -k 5.15.25_5.4.180
    echo "PACKAGED_OUTPUTPATH=${PWD}/out" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "PACKAGED_OUTPUTDATE=$(date +"%Y.%m.%d.%H%M")" >> $GITHUB_ENV
    echo "::set-output name=status::success"
```

This function is generally used to replace the kernel for quick packaging. If you have the `openwrt-armvirt-64-default-rootfs.tar.gz` file in your repository, when you want to use other kernel versions of OpenWrt, you can directly specify the relevant kernel for Quickly packaged, no longer waiting for a long firmware compilation.

- ### Use GitHub Action to packaging instructions

[For more instructions please see: .yml example](https://github.com/ophub/op/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-openwrt-s9xxx.yml)

In your .github/workflows/.yml file, after completing the compilation of Subtarget is ARMv8, add the following online packaging code:

```yaml
- name: Package Armvirt as OpenWrt
  uses: ophub/amlogic-s9xxx-openwrt@main
  with:
    armvirt64_path: openwrt/bin/targets/*/*/*.tar.gz
